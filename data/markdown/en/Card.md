### Journey of Learning and Creation

This section is my tech logbook.
Each card you see here represents not only a project but also a chapter of my journey and a little adventure I embarked on.

Here's what you can discover:
<details class="stat-info">
<summary>The Idea</summary>
The image and title will give you a quick idea of what the project is about.
These are the first sparks that ignited my curiosity and started the journey.
Clicking on them will take you to the project or a demo, if available. </details> 

<details class="stat-info">
<summary>The Heart of the Project</summary>
Clicking on the title, it is possible to see  code or documentation.
It's like opening a hatch and peeking into the roaring guts of the ship!
</details>

<details class="stat-info">
<summary>The Tools of the Trade</summary>
Each icon is a link to the technology or skill I used, just as a compass and stars were essential navigation tools. 
</details>

<details class="stat-info">
<summary>The Magic of the Moment</summary>
What about the stars text to each technology? It is a way to remember the challenges undertaken.
Examining old routes and rediscovering how many adventures enriched my experience!
</details>

<details class="stat-info">
<summary>The Time Portal</summary>
At the bottom, you'll find the edition and date. A way to capture time, like an ancient seal on a map from the past.
</details>

In simple words, this portfolio is my way of keeping track of where I've been and how much I've learned along the way.
Each project is a step forward, a new challenge overcome, and a reminder of how much more there is to explore in this vast world.

Happy exploring!
