Welcome to my personal portfolio! This space represents my journey in the world of development, where each project tells a story of learning and professional growth.

## 🚀 Overview

An interactive web portfolio that combines modern design with advanced technical features. Designed to be not just a showcase of my projects, but also an engaging and customizable user experience.

## 💭 Development Philosophy

This portfolio was intentionally developed with vanilla JavaScript and client-side data management, avoiding modern frameworks. This choice, while not optimal for production, reflects the true purpose of the project: exploration and learning.

### Why This Choice?

- **Technical Exploration**: I experimented with different approaches, prioritizing learning over code uniformity
- **Deep Understanding**: Working natively rather than with frameworks has deepened my understanding of fundamental web mechanisms
- **Client-Side**: Client-side data management, though not always optimal, allowed me to explore patterns and state management

Despite the experimental approach in code writing, I maintained user interface consistency and final experience quality as priorities.
