## Between Reality and Fantasy

If I'm not 3D printing things, then I'm playing D&D.
It's my way of balancing the tangible with the imaginary, reminding me that reality and imagination aren't two separate worlds, but they intertwine continuously, enriching our life experience.

In the end, I'm just a curious soul trying to make sense of the world, piece by piece... and whether that piece is 3D printed or exists only in my imagination, well, that's part of the fun!

And with that... I could go on forever, but I have a new adventure waiting for me!
