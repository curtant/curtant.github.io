## Exploration and Nature

My relationship with nature is constantly evolving.
Starting with scout camps when I was young, I never stopped.
In the future, I want to add pedals to the equation.
There's something special about traveling under your own power, offering a new perspective, and allowing a deeper, more sustainable connection with the landscape.
